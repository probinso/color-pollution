# Why Python
Python was selected for this course because it is a language both primary [contributors](../../AUTHORS.md) are familiar with. Python is a mature, simple, and expressive programming language. Python also has a large body of public prior work, that we leverage to decrease development release time.

Although most work is done in python3, there is some legacy python2.7 code that we will tend to as needed. We strongly encourage the use of python3 at this point. [Here](https://www.webucator.com/blog/2016/03/still-using-python-2-it-is-time-to-upgrade/) is a nice article about adoption of python3.

To help with this course, the complete playlist of python tutorial videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96V6k-MWWMhAXQmH0AJDKM6WnfpaCx4S). This will be broken into smaller topical lists on the youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-EKRSRFcQ1Uda8oGVVZl7Q).
