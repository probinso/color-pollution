# Introduction
Throughout the course code used in other sections, there are many topics that we may assume the reader is familiar with. This is intentional, as diving into certain programming topics may distract from that lesson plan. We expect that many participants are here to gain some intuition and experience with programming materials.

In this directory and section, we hope to cover such material. Here is located minimal sample code, and corresponding links to lecture material that should help bridge these gaps.

If you stumble on material that you feel is not sufficiently covered, then please let us know.
