### lightpolution

(charge coupled device - sensor architecture)

Visual spectra is a catagory of light polution. This is often in the light blue region. This is driven by 'peak sensor response' as found in the human eye. (550nm during the day, 500nm during night). 

CCD cameras found in telescopes are not sensative to the same spectra. The CCD cameras used in industry are modified with filters to limit the spectrum. Telescopes are often composed of multiple CCD cameras with differing filters.

The night sky is often bombarded with adulturants that change the percieved color. From the high end astronomer perspective the only spectrum that we have control over is light blue and green. 

The LED has a strong peak in the blue band. (high intensity blue light)

Low Sodium Bulbs give off light in a spectrum that is already poluted.

night glow - astronomers term for natrual events that cause spectral events in night sky.

'warm white' are lower blue peak, orange hue.

The bulb we are working with provides a 'warmer white' then is presently on the market.
