# Goals of this repository
We are hoping to gather and devleop lecture materials for a course we are designing **sensor systems and color polution**.

## Outline
- Introduction
    - What is color
        - [Matamerism Wiki] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color))
    - How do sensory systems, capture light and color
    - Human eye
- Filters and content goals
- Types of sensor systems/architecture
    - Keck
    - Eye
    - Camera
- Noise
- **Raw vs processed Images from a camera**
- Signal Noise
    - Scattering (from system)
    - Atmospheric physics (from environment)
- Limiting pollution for your sensor
- Artificial Lighting
- Understanding the human market
    - What do humans want to see?
    - What noise is caused in their environment?
- Understanding the astronomy market
    - What do astronomers want to see?
    - What noise is caused in their environment?
    - Simplest solutions
        - No light
        - Low pressure sodium with filter
        - Other light options
