# Project What/Why
- Develop low cost tools to quantitatively study light pollution
- Describe human eye response to light
- Describe how light pollution effects terrestrial telescopes

# Problem Statement
- Current measures for 'lighting needs' disregard metrics like 'blue light content'. Since 'blue light content' critically impacts many industries and habitats we hope to motivate a change in industry measurement standards.
- From nighttime photographs of lit street lamps, can we classify the type of bulb by approximating spectral profile?

- We must do this in a reproducible way that encourages subject participation and auditing.
- Must be easily installable.

# Strategy
- Standardize/Sanatize input image
- Identify light sources
- Extract RGB features from each lamp
- Classify lamps

# Tools used so far
- GitHub
  - Version Control
  - ZenHub
  - Jupyter and Markdown Rendering
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- ~1200 lines Python
  - argparse
  - imread, imhdr, Pillow
  - sklearn, scipy, numpy, matplotlib
  - PonyORM
- Jupyter

# Technical Goals
- Don't waste compute time
