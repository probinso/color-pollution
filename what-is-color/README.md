# What is Color?
When studying color, your goal is to understand:

- electromagnetic radiation
- sensor systems
- relationships between electromagnetic radiation and sensor systems
- color coordinate systems and their goals
    - CIE charts
	- Color-maps
	- RGB

# Electromagnetic Radiation
*... All elements who have energy produce electromagnetic radiation*

# Sensor Systems
Traditionally color refers to **human visible light**. Although this is a very limited definition, lets explore how to define this spectra.

## Human Eye
The human eye is a focusing lens containing cone cells of three types that act as sensors. L-cone, M-cone, S-cone cells have peak sensor response around wavelengths perceived as red, green, and blue light respectively. The spectra rendered by these cone cells in the human eye span ~400nm-700nm.
