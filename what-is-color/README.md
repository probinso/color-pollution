# What is Color?
When studying color, your goal is to understand:

- electromagnetic radiation
- sensor systems
- relationships between electromagnetic radiation and sensor systems
- color coordinate systems and their goals
    - CIE charts
	- Color-maps
	- RGB
- metamerism

# Electromagnetic Radiation
*... All elements who have energy radiate electromagnetic waves*

# Sensor Systems
Traditionally, the term `color` refers to **human visible light**. Although this is a very limited definition, lets explore how to better understand this spectra.

## Human Eye
The human eye is a focusing lens containing cone cells of three types that act as sensors. L-cone, M-cone, S-cone cells have peak sensor response around wavelengths perceived as red, green, and blue light respectively. The spectra rendered by these cone cells in the human eye span ~400nm-700nm.

Terestrial eyes evolved to discern colors in this limited spectrum as a result of **atmostpheric opacity**; a term we use to describe the spectral range of electromagnetic radiation able to pass through our atmosphere. The graphic below shows that 400-780nm (highlighted by the rainbow) is a consistant range with low *atmopheric distortion*.

Due to the valley represented in this graphic, you may ask why we are unable to discern colors in the 5cm to 20m range...
