# What is Color?
When studying color, your goal is to understand:

- electromagnetic radiation
- sensor systems
- relationships between electromagnetic radiation and sensor systems
- color coordinate systems and their goals
    - CIE charts
	- Color-maps
	- RGB
- metamerism

# Electromagnetic Radiation
*need to talk about electromagnetic radiation in form of waves*

# Sensor Systems
Traditionally, the term *color* refers to **human visible light**. Although this is a very limited definition, it establishes a good starting point for understanding perception of color. Because of this, the first sensor system we will discuss is the human eye, it's evolution and design. Next we will discuss imitating sensor systems like cameras and telescopes which will lead to a discussion about metamerism and RGB color mapping. Finally, we will discuss ways to express and communicate color like CIE charts and other color mapping options.

## Human Eye
The human eye is a focusing lens containing cone cells of three types that act as sensors. L-cone, M-cone, S-cone cells have peak sensor response around wavelengths perceived as red, green, and blue light respectively. The spectra rendered by these cone cells in the human eye span ~400nm-700nm.

Terestrial eyes evolved to discern colors in this limited spectrum as a result of **atmostpheric opacity**; a term we use to describe the spectral range of electromagnetic radiation able to pass through our atmosphere. The graphic below shows that 400-780nm (highlighted by the rainbow) is a consistant range with low *atmopheric distortion*.

cones are identified by photopigment moleculs that act like filter-sensor pairs

Due to the valley represented in this graphic... what about 9μm-10μm or 5cm-20m range... ?
