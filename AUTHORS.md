## Tim Robinson
I am the Research and Technology Manager at Esterline-Everett WA.  I conduct R&D activities in displays, imaging systems, and optical materials for display applications including specialty dyes, coatings, and polymers.  I have degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering.  As a evening hobby, I have been studying Python for about 3 years and currently use Jupyter/Python to model optics problems.  I would consider myself a reasonable hacker.
