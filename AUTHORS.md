## Philip Robinson
I have a BS in Computer Science and a minor in mathematics from Western Washington University, where I focused on Cryptography. I then worked in probabilistic programming languages at Galois Inc, gaining me exposure to machine learning and statistics. Python has been my primary langauge for the past four years. I'm currently most excited about scientific computing, open course models, and teaching.

## Tim Robinson
I am the Research and Technology Manager at Esterline-Everett WA.  I conduct R&D activities in displays, imaging systems, and optical materials for display applications including specialty dyes, coatings, and polymers.  I have degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering.  As a evening hobby, I have been studying Python for about 3 years and currently use Jupyter/Python to model optics problems.  I would consider myself a reasonable hacker.
