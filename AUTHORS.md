I have a BS in computer science and a minor in mathematics from Western Washington University, where I focused on Cryptography. I then worked in probabilistic programming languages at Galois Inc, gaining me exposure to machine learning and statistics. I'm currently most excited about scientific computing, open course models, and teaching.
